# AndroidRestaurantReview
Coursework for mobile application development in Kotlin.

The following application should allow the users to drop a review for a restaurant while they are authenticated.
Unauthenticated users should only be able to view reviews.
The application uses Firebase Firestore and Firebase Storage for storage of data and images, and Firebase Authentication for user management.
The credentials present in the strings.xml are dummy values, therefore the application will not work.

I am completely aware that the application is not coded up to industry standards, but I prioritized functionality over standards as the coursework
I completed this for, was awarding more points for having certain functionality working. Trial and error has been done, therefore there might be 
code which has no actual purpose, or random comments.
